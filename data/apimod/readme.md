    -   105 wavs automatically transcribed using BUT-FIT/whisper-ATC-czech-full model from HF

-   ALL
    105 wavs

## NOTES

-   WAV LENGTHS OK (<30s, for the own-split of the original wav)
-   SILENCE SHOULD BE EXCLUDED, NOISE POSSIBLE FOR USED WAVS

-   used only splitted wavs in 01_02_EL_LN_UN_VV_YADA, in 01_01_EL_LN_UJ_VV_YADA it looks like the wavs are almost the same, and there is less of them
